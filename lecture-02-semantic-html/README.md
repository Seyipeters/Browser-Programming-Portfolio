# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Added a semantic page structure using HTML5 elements
- Created a portfolio section with images, links, and embedded media
- Improved accessibility using skip links and alt text

---

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the document
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The header contains the main title of the page and personal introductory information, which defines the identity and purpose of the page.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<section>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio and Areas of Interest sections
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  Each section represents a standalone thematic grouping of related content, making the structure clear for both users and screen readers.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Around images and embedded video in the portfolio
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  These elements associate media with descriptive captions, improving meaning and accessibility.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip link to allow keyboard users to bypass repeated navigation
- Used semantic HTML elements to improve screen reader navigation
- Provided descriptive alt text for all images
- Used correct heading hierarchy for better content structure

---

## 4. What I learned
- How semantic HTML improves accessibility and page clarity
- The importance of meaningful structure beyond visual layout
- How screen readers interpret HTML structure

---

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing more descriptive alternative text
- Structuring larger pages with multiple articles and sections

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is: Basic semantic structure guidance
- What I modified manually: Content text, links, and personal details

# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Linked external CSS file
- Applied typography and spacing rules
- Styled header, footer, and navigation
- Made images responsive
- Added layout width constraint

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- Element selector (body, h1, img)
- Group selector (header, footer)
- Descendant selector (nav a, nav ul)
- Class selector (.card)
- ID selector (#works)
- Pseudo-class (nav a:hover)

## One thing I struggled with
- Understanding the difference between margin and padding

## One improvement I want to do next
- Improve layout using Flexbox in the next lecture
